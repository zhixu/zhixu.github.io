            <h3>Hey there!</h3>
            <br/>
            <p>I’m a programmer, graphic design enthusiast and coffee drinker located in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>
            
            <p>As a programmer, I want to build applications that are easy to use and look great. I’m interested in learning new technologies and creating organized, maintainable code. My favorite programming language is Java (explicit typing is ♥). </p>
            
            <p>In my free time, I like to create graphics and art. user experience is also very important to me. I’ve been wielding the Photoshop pen tool since middle school and also have inevitably volunteered to create graphics for various internships and jobs.</p>
