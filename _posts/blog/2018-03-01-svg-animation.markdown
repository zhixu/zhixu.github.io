I stumbled across this type of animation while browsing through the anime.js library. I wanted to include it on my own personal website, but didn't want to load a whole entire library just for that one effect. I Googled a little further and stumbled across this post: https://jakearchibald.com/2013/animated-line-drawing-svg/ which is what I have been following. 

I've used SVGs before in the form of FontAwesome icons, and I knew some of the benefits of using this type of representation using Bezier curves. However, I've never created one, so I'm documenting the process I've gone through to do so.

1) Create SVG graphic.

I did this in Adobe Illustrator. However, I'm still using an older version of the software, so I had to save it as .ai and convert it into SVG using https://cloudconvert.com/ai-to-svg

It's quite verbose and if you want to, you can further minify it using: http://www.svgminify.com/
