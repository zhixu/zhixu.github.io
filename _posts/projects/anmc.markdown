*Technologies Used:* PHP, Bootstrap, Wordpress, Javascript, jQuery, HTML, CSS


The main goal of this website redesign was to modernize the website and to facilitate the business's ability to update the website without the involvement of a web developer.

I chose Wordpress as a CMS so that the business can have a pre-built UI to manage the website content. The single-page landing page layout was designed so that information would be easily accessable to the end user. The additional article pages helped with the website's SEO. Furthermore, there is a separate category of articles for patient testimonials and reviews which the business can easily add to, giving the establishment further credibility.

The contact form at the bottom of the page allows the end user to easily contact the business and prevents the business's email address from being scraped and spammed with malicious emails.
