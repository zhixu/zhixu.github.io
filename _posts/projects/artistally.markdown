Technologies Used: Angular 2, Typescript, Django, Python, mySQL, HTML, CSS

This is a personal project that I've been working on for a while. The main motivation is to help full-time artists keep tabs on convention venues. Users would be able  

The old application designed in 2015 used Django, Bootstrap and jQuery. I was starting out learning web development and didn't know how to do things. Used Twitter Bootstrap.



I'm currently in the process of updating this application. Now uses Django REST API with mySQL DB and Angular 2 front end. Angular 2 was chosen because I like how two way data binding and components worked. Plus, I wanted to redo the front end and write all of my CSS from scratch to challenge myself.
