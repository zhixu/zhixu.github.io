Technologies Used: Angular 2, Typescript, Django, Python, mySQL, HTML, CSS

Personal project. Old application designed in 2015 using Django. It was a mess, I was starting out learning web development and didn't know how to do things. Used Twitter Bootstrap.


Now uses Django REST API with mySQL DB and Angular 2 front end. Angular 2 was chosen because I like how two way data binding and components worked. Plus, I wanted to redo the front end and write all of my CSS from scratch to challenge myself.
