Technologies Used: Angular 2, Typescript, Bootstrap, HTTPD, J2EE, Glassfish, MySQL/MariaDB, HTML, CSS

During my time at the company, I cycled through numerous products' iterations. I gained a rapid understanding of Angular 2, and new knowledge of web security (implementation of JWT, building a DB that stored login credentials of multiple websites). This position had opened my eyes to the perils of username/password login model that is the common standard on the Internet and the need to transition into a passwordless login model.

### Single Sign-On Application

UI/UX design -- Questions: ho

Front end implementation -- this was the early beta stages of Angular 2 (CLI didn't exist yet), so I learned how to use Webpack to condense and uglify code to speed up loading times.

Abstracting data so that nothing gets repeated -- making classes that mirrored parts of the database and setting up JSON data to be in a similar structure.

REST API creation -- what makes an API RESTful? 

### PKI to FIDO Application

Asset creation; an understanding how SSL certificates worked.

### Healthcare Application

SOAP API creation

### Banking Mobile Application
Mock ups and UI design -- solving the problem of what FIDO would look like on a phone application and how to configure it in a way that would make sense to the user.
